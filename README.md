# Samsung Auto Hotspot

Auto Hotspot is a feature available on select Samsung devices that allows you to share your mobile internet connection with other devices, such as laptops or tablets, without the need for a separate hotspot device. With Auto Hotspot, your Samsung smartphone becomes a portable hotspot, providing internet access to nearby devices such as tablets, laptops, or other. To activate Auto Hotspot, you need to sign in to your Samsung account on both your phone and the device you want to connect to. Once you’re signed in, your phone will automatically connect to the other device when it’s nearby and has a Wi-Fi connection. You can also configure several features and settings to keep your hotspot private or reduce battery consumption.
